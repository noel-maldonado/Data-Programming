#(Health application: BMI ) Revise Listing 4.6, ComputeBMI.py, to let users enter
#their weight in pounds and their height in feet and inches. For example, if a person
#is 5 feet and 10 inches, you will enter 5 for feet and 10 for inches. Here is a sample
#run:

weight = eval(input("Enter weight in pounds: "))
feet = eval(input("Enter feet: "))
inches = eval(input("Enter inches: "))






print("BMI is (bmi")
print("You are 'Normal'")
