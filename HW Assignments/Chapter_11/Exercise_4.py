# (Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
# employees are stored in a table. Each row records an employeeâ€™s seven-day work
# hours with seven columns. For example, the following table stores the work hours
# for eight employees. Write a program that displays employees and their total hours
# in decreasing order of the total hours.

workHours = [
    [2, 4, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8], #employee 0
    [7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4], #employee 1
    [3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2], #employee 2
    [9, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 1], #employee 3
    [3, 5, 4, 3, 6, 3, 8], #employee 4
    [3, 4, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4], #employee 5
    [3, 7, 4, 8, 3, 8, 4], #employee 6
    [6, 3, 5, 9, 2, 7, 9]  #employee 7
