#   (Find the highest score) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number
#   of students and each studentâ€™s score, and displays the highest score. Assume that
#   the input is stored in a file named score.txt, and the program obtains the input from
#   the file.


#Does not specify that I have to collect the students names only the scores.
