# (Convert feet into meters) Write a program that reads a number in feet, converts it
# to meters, and displays the result. One foot is 0.305 meters. Here is a sample run:
# Enter a value for feet: 16.5 *Enter*
# 16.5 feet is 5.0325 meters
feet = eval(input('Enter a value for feet: '))
meters = feet * 0.305
print(feet, 'feet is', meters, 'in meters')
